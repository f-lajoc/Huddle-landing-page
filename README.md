## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Query


### What I learned

I finally realized the benefit of using relative units which makes it easier for responsiveness

I figured a way to check for Responsiveness across several devices for free using the trebedit code editor on mobile phone--just by watching ads and i get to use their premium package for a day

I got better at using Media query

I started using flexbox


### Continued development

I'd continue using relative units, love to get better at using flexbox and then lay my hands on grid&animations

### Useful resources

- [Google search](https://www.google.com) - Random google search when i get stuck.
- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com) - My go-to site when i forget somethings.
